# HyperNova Chain (HNC)

A next-generation blockchain platform integrating AI, quantum resistance, scalability, complete decentralization, and energy efficiency.

## Core Features

- **Quantum Proofed Hybrid Proof Consensus**: Combining Proof of AI (PoAI) and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- **Adaptive Multi-chain Sharding**: Dynamic optimization with 10,000+ TPS
- **Distributed Quantum Storage (DQS)**: Quantum-encrypted distributed storage
- **AI-driven Smart Contracts (ASC)**: Self-optimizing contracts with error prediction
- **DAO Plus Governance**: AI-assisted proposal generation and evaluation
- **Quantum-resistant Security**: Built-in protection against quantum computing attacks

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (for core blockchain)
- Python 3.8+ (for AI functionality)
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend and SDK)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/enablerdao/NeuraChain.git
cd NeuraChain
```

2. Set up the core blockchain:

```bash
cd core
cargo build
```

3. Set up the AI module:

```bash
cd ../ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up the SDK:

```bash
cd ../sdk
npm install
npm run build
```

5. Set up the frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Running the Components

1. Start the core blockchain node:

```bash
cd core
cargo run
```

2. Start the AI API server:

```bash
cd ai
python run_api.py
```

3. Start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

## Technical Specifications

### Consensus Mechanism: "Quantum Proofed Hybrid Proof"

- **Proof of AI (PoAI)**: AI models validate blocks by analyzing patterns and ensuring security
- **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Stakeholders elect validators to produce blocks
- **Quantum-resistant algorithms**: Lattice-based cryptography protects against quantum attacks

### Scalability

- **Adaptive Multi-chain Sharding**: Dynamically adjusts shard count based on network load
- **10,000+ TPS**: High throughput for enterprise-grade applications
- **Zero-knowledge rollups**: Layer 2 scaling for even higher throughput

### Data Storage: "Distributed Quantum Storage (DQS)"

- Quantum-encrypted distributed storage
- Complete data recovery capabilities
- Balance of privacy and transparency

### Smart Contract Functionality

- **AI-driven Smart Contracts (ASC)**: Self-optimizing with error prediction
- **Multi-language support**: Rust, Solidity, and more
- **Formal verification**: Built-in tools for contract verification
