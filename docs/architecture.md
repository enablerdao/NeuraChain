- Governance interface

### SDK (TypeScript)

The SDK enables developers to:

- Interact with the blockchain
- Manage wallets and transactions
- Deploy and interact with smart contracts
- Use AI models
- Participate in governance

## Consensus Mechanism

HyperNova Chain uses a hybrid consensus mechanism called "Quantum Proofed Hybrid Proof" that combines:

1. **Proof of AI (PoAI)**: Validators train and use AI models to validate blocks. The AI models analyze transaction patterns, detect anomalies, and ensure security.

2. **Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)**: Token holders stake their tokens and vote for validators. The elected validators take turns producing blocks.

3. **Quantum Resistance**: All cryptographic operations use quantum-resistant algorithms to protect against quantum computing attacks.

## Sharding Architecture

HyperNova Chain uses adaptive multi-chain sharding to achieve high scalability:

1. **Dynamic Sharding**: The number of shards adjusts automatically based on network load.

2. **Cross-Shard Communication**: Shards can communicate with each other through a secure cross-shard protocol.

3. **Shard Allocation**: Transactions are assigned to shards based on their characteristics and the current load.

## Storage Architecture

The Distributed Quantum Storage (DQS) system provides:

1. **Quantum Encryption**: Data is encrypted using quantum-resistant algorithms.

2. **Distributed Storage**: Data is stored across multiple nodes for redundancy and availability.

3. **Data Recovery**: The system can recover data even if some nodes fail.

## Security Features

HyperNova Chain includes several security features:

1. **Quantum Resistance**: All cryptographic operations use quantum-resistant algorithms.

2. **AI-based Anomaly Detection**: AI models detect suspicious activities and potential attacks.

3. **Formal Verification**: Smart contracts can be formally verified to ensure correctness.

4. **Multi-signature Support**: Transactions can require multiple signatures for added security.

## Governance Model

The DAO Plus governance model includes:

1. **On-chain Voting**: Token holders can vote on proposals.

2. **AI-assisted Proposals**: AI models help generate and evaluate proposals.

3. **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate their voting power.

4. **Quadratic Voting**: Voting power scales with the square root of tokens to prevent plutocracy.

## Future Directions

Future development will focus on:

1. **Interoperability**: Improving cross-chain communication.

2. **Privacy Features**: Adding zero-knowledge proofs and other privacy technologies.

3. **Advanced AI Integration**: Deeper integration of AI into all aspects of the blockchain.

4. **Quantum Computing Support**: Preparing for the quantum computing era.
